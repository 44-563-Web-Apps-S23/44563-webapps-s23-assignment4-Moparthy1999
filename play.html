        <h4>THE BOOR

            ANTON TCHEKOV
        </h4>
        <h5 class="LUKA name">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">It isn't right, ma'am. You're wearing yourself out! The maid and
            the cook have gone looking for berries; everything that breathes is
            enjoying life; even the cat knows how to be happy--slips about the
            courtyard and catches birds--but you hide yourself here in the house as
            though you were in a cloister. Yes, truly, by actual reckoning you
            haven't left this house for a whole year.</p>
            
        <h5 class="POPOV name">MRS. POPOV.</h5> <p class="speech">And I shall never leave it--why should I? My life is over.
            He lies in his grave, and I have buried myself within these four walls.
            We are both dead.</p>
            
        <h5 class="LUKA name">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">There you are again! It's too awful to listen to, so it is!
            Nikolai Michailovitch is dead; it was the will of the Lord, and the Lord
            has given him eternal peace. You have grieved over it and that ought to
            be enough. Now it's time to stop. One can't weep and wear mourning
            forever! My wife died a few years ago. I grieved for her. I wept a whole
            month--and then it was over. Must one be forever singing lamentations?
            That would be more than your husband was worth!</p> <p class="direction">[_He sighs._]</p> <p class="speech">You have
            forgotten all your neighbors. You don't go out and you receive no one.
            We live--you'll pardon me--like the spiders, and the good light of day
            we never see. All the livery is eaten by the mice--as though there
            weren't any more nice people in the world! But the whole neighborhood
            is full of gentlefolk. The regiment is stationed in
            Riblov--officers--simply beautiful! One can't see enough of them! Every
            Friday a ball, and military music every day. Oh, my dear, dear ma'am,
            young and pretty as you are, if you'd only let your spirits live--!
            Beauty can't last forever. When ten short years are over, you'll be glad
            enough to go out a bit and meet the officers--and then it'll be too
            late.</p>
            
        <h5 class="POPOV name">MRS. POPOV.</h5> <p class="direction">[_Resolutely._]</p> <p class="speech">Please don't speak of these things again.
            You know very well that since the death of Nikolai Michailovitch my life
            is absolutely nothing to me. You think I live, but it only seems so. Do
            you understand? Oh, that his departed soul may see how I love him! I
            know, it's no secret to you; he was often unjust toward me, cruel,
            and--he wasn't faithful, but I shall be faithful to the grave and prove
            to him how _I_ can love. There, in the Beyond, he'll find me the same as
            I was until his death.</p>
            
        <h5 class="LUKA name">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">What is the use of all these words, when you'd so much rather go
            walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap,
            and visit the neighbors?</p>
            
        <h5 class="POPOV name">MRS. POPOV.</h5> <p class="direction">[_Weeping._]</p> <p class="speech">Oh!</p>
            
        <h5 class="LUKA name">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">Madam, dear madam, what is it? In Heaven's name!</p>
            
        <h5 class="POPOV name">MRS. POPOV.</h5> <p class="speech">He loved Tobby so! He always drove him to the Kortschagins
            or the Vlassovs. What a wonderful horse-man he was! How fine he looked
            when he pulled at the reins with all his might! Tobby, Tobby--give him
            an extra measure of oats to-day!</p>
            
         <h5 class="LUKA name">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">Yes, ma'am.</p>
            
        <h5 class="POPOV name">MRS. POPOV.</h5> <p class="direction">[_Shudders._]</p> <p class="speech">What's that? I am at home to no one.</p>
